        This is a page of my sketchbook. Currently I was feeling very frusturated on how facial expressions were, <i>(bottom left)</i> so I tried to practice them. They dont looks so bad, but I will practice more on angles and realistic expressions. I also want to tackle more shading projects and textures, so that drawings likes <i>(on the right)</i> will look more organic.</P>
