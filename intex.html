                    This is a page of my sketchbook. Currently I was feeling very frusturated on how facial expressions were, <i>(bottom left)</i> so I tried to practice them. They dont looks so bad, but I will practice more on angles and realistic expressions. I also want to tackle more shading projects and textures, so that drawings likes <i>(on the right)</i> will look more organic.</P>

                    On the left I decided to study muscle anatomy <i>(top left)</i> along as physical perspective. I got very frusturated during the process that I wanted to fucking flip the table. Incredibly annoying when your so hyperfocused and random things keep happening to you. <i>The face drawing on the right</i> pretty much sums up my frustration. </P>

                    I had the day off today so I had some extra time drawing. The bottom left one reminds me of the Matrix for some reason. Probably because of the Matrix: Ressurections movie poster for Max that theres a strong resemblence. Speaking about the movie, I wanted to watch it, but i'd probably not know what the fuck is going on. Anyways, <i>top right</i> was a facial expression implementing shading techniques from <a href= "https://youtu.be/70Z8iY0Q2Gw" target = "_self">this</a> for comics.</p>

                    I built a mechanuical keyboard. Almost broke it like 5 times, especially when handling the pcb. Although its fine, im still really scared that its ghonna friggin explode on me one of these days. It does feel buttery smooth though, <i>Gateron Yellows</i> really do the job well. Perfect mix of being sensitive without the long travel. I think I tried <i>Cherry Silvers</i>, and although they felt amazing, its incredibly easy to accidently hit a key. Pretty annoying, and the big killer for me. So if your looking something to fix that, <i>Gateron Yellows</i> could be your go-to.
