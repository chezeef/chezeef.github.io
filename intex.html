            This is a page of my sketchbook. Currently I was feeling very frusturated on how facial expressions were, <i>(bottom left)</i> so I tried to practice them. They dont looks so bad, but I will practice more on angles and realistic expressions. I also want to tackle more shading projects and textures, so that drawings likes <i>(on the right)</i> will look more organic.</P>

                    On the left I decided to study muscle anatomy <i>(top left)</i> along as physical perspective. I got very frusturated during the process that I wanted to fucking flip the table. Incredibly annoying when your so hyperfocused and random things keep happening to you. <i>The face drawing on the right</i> pretty much sums up my frustration.
