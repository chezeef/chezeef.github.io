                    This is a page of my sketchbook. Currently I was feeling very frusturated on how facial expressions were, <i>(bottom left)</i> so I tried to practice them. They dont looks so bad, but I will practice more on angles and realistic expressions. I also want to tackle more shading projects and textures, so that drawings likes <i>(on the right)</i> will look more organic.</P>

                    On the left I decided to study muscle anatomy <i>(top left)</i> along as physical perspective. I got very frusturated during the process that I wanted to fucking flip the table. Incredibly annoying when your so hyperfocused and random things keep happening to you. <i>The face drawing on the right</i> pretty much sums up my frustration. </P>

                    I had the day off today so I had some extra time drawing. The bottom left one reminds me of the Matrix for some reason. Probably because of the Matrix: Ressurections movie poster for Max that theres a strong resemblence. Speaking about the movie, I wanted to watch it, but i'd probably not know what the fuck is going on. Anyways, <i>top right</i> was a facial expression implementing shading techniques from <a href= "https://youtu.be/70Z8iY0Q2Gw" target = "_self">this</a> for comics.</p>

                    I built a mechanuical keyboard. Almost broke it like 5 times, especially when handling the pcb. Although its fine, im still really scared that its ghonna friggin explode on me one of these days. It does feel buttery smooth though, <i>Gateron Yellows</i> really do the job well. Perfect mix of being sensitive without the long travel. I think I tried <i>Cherry Silvers</i>, and although they felt amazing, its incredibly easy to accidently hit a key. Pretty annoying, and the big killer for me. So if your looking something to fix that, <i>Gateron Yellows</i> could be your go-to.

                    Ahh my bad. Well I havent updated this in about, 8 days. Well see, Ive been having trouble with applying css into this html website, and im not sure githubs really feeling it with me. Ill fix it tho, youtuve tutorials and stackoverflow are of course the backbone of this. Anyways, Ive been feeling pretty good, just my head is killing me, and it makes it difficult to focus.

                    Its been weeks. I think ill try to update at least once a week. Im still wondering what to make out of this website. I guess ill just use it to dump all my "creative" farts. Anyways I went to go watch <i>BELLE<i/> last week, and gosh was it amazing. The visuals, characters, plot, was all a A. Although the villan was kind of hard to like, possibly due to the dubs voice, it wasnt to the point they were it was unbearable. Anyways, The Fallout was also good, just not great.
